E.g: \"I like dogs\" or \"I work on sales\", etc.\n- Put all papers inside a cup and start the game.\n- Choose one student to start introducing himself:\n    - First name and last.\n    - What would you like to be called?\n    - What do you do now? (for work)\n    - What do you plan on doing when you become a developer?\n- Then, that student must pick one random paper from the cup and guess how is the person that wrote it.\n- After guessing, the person who wrote it must come next and introduce himself and pick another paper... etc.\n\n## `5 min` Present the team\n\nEveryone introduces himself: Chief of Admissions, Chief of Career Support, Chief of Education, Main instructor, and teacher assistant.\n\n## `15 min` Install the tools\n\nStart with Gitpod, invite all students, and make sure they are able to create workspaces and what the academy boilerplates are. \n\n## `10 min` Go over prework concepts really fast\n\nCheck if the students completed the prework, if ~70% of the students finished the prework you can continue with the rest of the class, otherwise you will have to postpone today's topics and today's focus only con starting/completing the prework projects and concepts with the students.\n\n\n## If 70% of the students completed the prework you can continue with the rest of the day:\n\n### How does the internet works?\n\n1. The world is divided between servers and clients.\n2. We call \"clients\" the computers with browsers or mobile apps.\n3. We call servers where the centralized database is.\n\n### HTTP Request vs Response**\n\n- The rules used for this client-sever communication is called HTTP, which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.\n- The way that you get the website is by sending a \"Request\" to the server. This tells the server what website or resource you are looking to view/use. The server then responds with the information.\n- The server then sends a response, which tells will confirm the receipt of the request and let your computer know that it will begin sending data.\n- This back and forth process will continue with more Request=>Response pairs until you have finished loading your remote resource.\n\n### Everything is text!\n\n- With HTTP, it’s important to focus on the first T in the acronym, which stands for `Text`. In this protocol, everything is sent back and forth as TEXT.\n- While there are other protocols out there, for now, we want to remember that with HTTP – Everything is TEXT.\n- Make students open a picture with Notepad/TextEdit they will see the text that represents the image.\n\n### Browser Interpretation\n\n- After your browser uses the HTTP protocol and receives the data as text, it then has the job of interpreting that text and converting it to the correct visual format.\n\n#### HTML\n\n- The first TEXT-based format we will see is HTML.\n- HTML its all about `<tags>` you open and close tags to give them basic format.\n- There are a lot of HTML tags but you only have to know a few and you can always google them.\n    - Explain the basic tags like `<p>`,`<div>`,`<a>`,`<span>`, headings (`<h1>`,`<h2>`,etc).\n\n[[demo]]\n| :point_up: The most important thing to remember in HTML is to ALWAYS BE CLOSING!\n\n#### Always Be Closing and Indentation Matters**\n\n- Everything is going to be done in blocks of code.\n- First you open the block, then you close the block.\n\n### CSS vs HTML\n```css\n#id_selector { property: value; }\n.class_selector { property: value; }\ntag_selector { property: value; }\n```\n\n## `20 min` Start the new content: Advanced CSS\n\n### Specificity\n\n- Do not use ID as CSS selectors (use specificity).\n- The class selector is the most used because it can be reused all over your website.\n- Show this [video that explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In78mSOHmls) specificity to the class.\n- Combine selectors to get more specific about which element you are styling\n- Ask if anyone remembers what we said DRY Programming means? Don’t repeat yourself.\nYou may think it’s funny that they call the opposite of DRY -  WET programming, which they have given the following titles to:  \"write everything twice\", \"we enjoy typing\" or \"waste everyone's time\"**\n\n\n### Box Model\n\n- Box layout means that most elements can be thought of as boxes: with margin, padding, with and height.\n- There are 4 main parts to the typical box model: (draw the following on the board or show picture from breathcode)\n    - Content: this is what is inside the box\n    - Padding: this is spacing between the border and content (inside box also)\n    - Border: this is the edge of the box\n    - Margin: this is spacing between the outside of the box and the next element over in any direction. (which could be the edge of the page, another div, a paragraph, or even an image)\n- You can also have a background color or image, this will show in the content area of your box.\n\n#### The Display Property:\n\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline`: Display block its what makes an element behave like a box, inline elements have no margins.\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\n- Display: flex; its the main tool for building complex layouts because it easily allows having several divs on the same line (columns).\n- I recommend going over the CSS and HTML [cheat sheets that we have available on the breathco.de platform under Assets](https://breatheco.de/assets/).\n \n## Display Flex and how important it is.\n\nTake some time to explain display:flex and how it is used on today's project.\n\n#### The Position Property:\n\n- Position:fixed follows the user, it is mainly used for anoying modals or popups.\n- If one element has position:relative must always be companioned by one or more childs with position:absolute. Its broadly used for relating two elements to each other (one follows the other)\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\n\n## `2:30 hr` Start the project!\n\nRead the instructions out loud with the class, make sure they understand.\n\nStudents must start discussing on the whiteboard a strategy about the project.\n- From top to bottom identify the tags you will be using.\n- When to use `display:inline-block` and/or `position:absolute` or `position:relative`.\n- Setup the project with one `index.html` and one `styles.css`\n\n\n\nAnswer questions individually with your teacher assistants.\n"

Navbar\n2. Card\n3. Modal: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#live-demo\n\n### The Basic Workflow (asuming you have a wireframe or design)\n\n1. Build your basic layout with the Grid (container, row and collumns)\n1. Identify the components you will need (use piece of paper)\n2. Copy & Paste the component code into your website.\n3. Customize the component for your specific design.\n4. Adjust anything else overriding with css styles on your own sylesheet.\n5. Remember the utility classes to avoid doing to much custom CSS.\n\n### Helper/Utility Classes that come with bootstrap*\n\nThese are classes you can attach that do things such as control margin or padding, control borders, or even float elements.\nFor example, if you wanted no margin on the left of the element, you can add the class ml-0 to the element and it will set the left margin to zero.\n\n### Layout using Grid system\n\n- Explain 12 column layout and how it works\n- every line is a Row\n- this row holds columns as immediate childs\n- every Row on a page has 12 columns\n- columns are equally measured in percentages so they are responsive.\n- the basic sizes are: col, col-xs, col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl\n\n### Bootstrap does not have fonts or icons\n\nWe use google fonts and font awesome for that.\n\n## `2:30min` Have class work on bootstrap instagram.\n\n- Students gather in pairs tos strategize first (best practice)\n- Read instructions out loud and have them build a strategy\n- Have them identify the components.\n\nDo not talk more, they will not be able to process it because they are overwhelmed, just help them code."

You can collaborate on projects easily\n2. see a history of revisions\n3. Roll back to previous versions if a revision fails (version control)\n4. Resolve code conflicts so that 2 developers don’t overwrite each other’s code.\n\nGit is a necessity to any developer working today as it’s resolved many of the issues of working on a team or keeping version history on a project.\n\n## For Next Class\n\nNext class we will review GIT in more detail.

                        "extended_instructions": "# First time using Git\n\nLast class you have introduced GitHub, students must have finish reading and watching videos and building their public profile with YML.\n\n### About the GIT authentication:\n\nThe academy does not want to explain much about GIT SSH Authentication because it can be a cumbersome concept for now, we strongly recomend always using HTTP during the course and let students learn about SSH later.\n\n### The Commit Object\n\nHere is the lesson that talks about that: [https://content.breatheco.de/lesson/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#commit-objects](https://content.breatheco.de/lesson/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#commit-objects) \n\nBasically, a commit is a snapshot (picture) of what your project looked at during the moment of your commit. \n\nCommits represent a change in the current code, so if you don’t have any changes, you will receive a message saying there is nothing to commit.\n\nThere are four main parts in a commit:\n\n1. Set of files which make up your snapshot at that time\n2. Instructions pointing to the Parent commit objects\n3. An SH1 (hash) name that serves as a unique identifier for that specific commit.\n4. Commits also typically have comments, which should explain what was changed or addressed in the current commit\n\n### The HEAD\n\nThe heads of the repository are like the \"revision history of the project.\"  \n\nA revision history is a list of commit objects that altogether contain all the changes that you and your other team members have made to the project files.\n\nEvery time you make a new commit, the head will move to that new commit.  (This way you are able to have access to the entire project history of commits.)\n\nIt is possible to move the head to a different commit, however, you must remember that commits made after the commit to which the head is pointing at are not possible to be reviewed.\n\n### The Stage\n\nWhen creating a commit, you select which files you wish to add to the commit. This is called \"staging\" your commit. (basically, preparing your formal commit object)\n\nTypically, you will use \"git add .\" which adds all files to your stage for the current commit, then follow it with your commit.\n\n### Branch\n\nA branch allows you to work on a specific feature of code without compromising the main code in a repository.  [http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits](http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits) \n\nThat means that each branch is a separate revision history.\n\nThe main branch of code in the repository is called \"Master\" typically\n\nYou can have as many different branches as you want in a repository/project.\n\nEach branch has it’s own head which resides on the last commit of that branch. So if you have two branches, \"Master\" and “login”, each will have their own head on the last commit.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the feature you developed, you can merge it back in to master and it will bring all code changes, along with replace the head on master with the new head.\n\n### Typical Flow\n\n1. All new projects have to be initialized with git.  (git init)\n    - This creates a git folder with all elements that define the git project.\n    - At this point, it’s also good to set the remote for your project. This will tell the project what the address is for your repository so that you can push changes later.\n\n 2. the command for this is:  git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git \n\n 3. where the address at the end is your repository address or SSH address.\n\n26. Whenever you have to stage your changes, you use \"git add\". As mentioned before, to add all file changes, “git add .” \n\n > Note: conversely, you can condense this into the git commit by adding a flag \"-a\" which means add all files to the commit stage\n\n4. Once you made changes to your code and you are ready to commit: You create a commit object by using \"git commit -m ‘commit message’\" or if you have not used git add, you can use the -a flag as mentioned before.\n\n5. At this point, you want to use ‘git push’ to upload your changes\n\n6. If you need to create a new branch:\n\n    - git checkout -b [branch name]\n\n    - next you need to switch to that branch to work on it\n\n        3. git checkout [branch name]\n\n    - when you complete your changes on a new branch, you merge the changes back in using the following:\n\n        4. git merge [other branch name]\n\n\n## Commit vs PUSH\n\nWe already discussed that a commit will allow you to create a new commit object. This is a local bundle you are preparing to upload.\n\nWhen you finish your commit, you have to attempt to upload that code to the repository.\n\nThis is where git push comes in. It allows you to attempt to upload your changes to the repository.\n\nIf there are any issues where a conflict has arisen, you will have to resolve the conflicts before pushing your changes.\n\n## Resolving Conflicts\n\nFor conflicts, git will notify you that there are issues.\n\n- this typically occurs when two people are trying to modify the same file(s).\n\nTo proceed you need to:\n\n- Get the new changes downloaded to your computer with ‘git pull’ or if you are on a branch, ‘git pull origin branch-name’\n\n- Then you will be asked to merge the changes \n\n- Here you will have to edit the files with conflicts and resolve any changes. \n\n- Once you have resolved the conflicts, you can attempt to push changes again.\n\n## Start Coding With The Students!\n\n** At this point we will start the assignment for the git collaborative portfolio project.**\n\n** Break the class into groups and assign a section of the portfolio project**\n\n** [https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-collaborative-html-website/blob/master/website1/designs/guide.jpg]**(https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-collaborative-html-website/blob/master/website1/designs/guide.jpg)\n\n* Use peer programming to complete the section quickly, then upload the changes to the repository your professor has provided.\n\nTeacher will clone the repo in a new class repository and will handle updating the name of the template parts so that the site functions properly.\n\n### Students Homework: \n\nFinish all pending projects including todays."

Students will be overwhelmed.\n\n### Why Javascript?\n\nStatic websites are just blog posts, but was about interactive applications like Instagram, Facebook, etc.?\n\nJavascript lets us create dynamic HTML and CSS based on user or system interactions, for example:\n- Adding an `li` to a `ul` when the user clicks on a button.\n- Showing a banner or ad (publicity) based on the user IP address.\n- Ask for information to a database.\n- Write on a database using AJAX.\n- etc.\n\nBasically: Javascript its a programming language to generate HTML and CSS (text) based on events.\n\n## The`<script>` tag:\n\nAll javascript must be done on a separate sheet (best practice).\nYou have to import to put that tag **right before the body closing tag**.\nThe code execution starts on the `window.onload = function(){}` like this:\n```\n//index.js\n\nwindow.onload = function(){\n    //your code here\n}\n\n//you can declar other functions here, but please don't write code outside functions\n```\n\n**Warning**: Carefull explaining the windown.onload, because today we are not suppose to overwhelme them with events and functions.\n\n### Explain Variables:\n\nVariables are javascript’s version of containers that hold some information.\n\nAn example of this is:\n\n1. Let’s say we needed to store someone’s birthday for an age verification script\n2. One of our variables might be: `var day = 29;`\n3. There are three things going on here:\n    - First, the computer interprets the letters VAR as the beginnig of a variable declaration.\n    - After `VAR` it must always come the variable name: in our case is called `day`.\n    - Secondly, we are storing a value of 29 in that variable.\n    - Finally, notice the syntax. All javascript lines typically end with semicolon. There will be some cases where you don’t use semicolon and we will learn those later but for now, all lines are with semicolon.\n\n3. Given that we defined the var above, `var day = 29;` if we want to display it for testing, we can show use the javascript console:\n    - Explain how to open the google inspector console\n    - So to display the variable, you would use: `console.log(day);`\n    - will print on the console `29`\n\n### Data Types\n\nYou can store 6 differnt types of values: Strings, Integers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects, Functions, Null and Undefined.\n\n- Boolean - true/false\n- String - always in quotes\n- Number - any type of number -  integer numbers, negative numbers, decimal numbers, floats, etc.\n- Undefined - nothing was set or specified for the variable. so the variable has no value\n- Null - When a database or function returns nothing, it returns null\n- Array - data sets [2,3,4,\"cat\",242,\"d\"]\n- Object - You can explain objects like real life objects that are comprised by other datatypes, you can use the analogy with HTML Tags because the tags have properties taht describe them further. Objects behave the same way.\n\nNote: Data Types on Breatheco.de: [http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types](http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types)\n\n### String Contatenation\n\nSuming two integers its not the same as suming two strings, as web developers we are going to be creating HTML using Javascript, we will contatenate like crazy!\n\n### Arrays\n\nSince we just learned what an array is, let’s look at some basic properties of an array:\n\n1. value or item: The value stored on each position.\n2. index or position: the position of the given value in the array `note: the first position starts at 0`\n3. length - the total length of the array\n\nDeclaring an array [http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-an-array-define-array](http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-an-array-define-array#how-to-declare-an-array)\n\nTo initialize an array , you can use the following:\n```js\nlet myArray = [];\n```\nThis defines the array as an empty set so that you can add values later.\n\nNote: Don’t use, use let or const.\n\nYou can also initialize an array with a value in it**\n```js\nlet myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];\n```\nDisplaying the value of an array using console, we can show it as `console.log(myArray[0]);`\n\nUpdating a specific position: `myArray[4]=3;`\n\nGenerating a random number using `Math.rand()`\n\n## Javascript Exercises and Learnpack\n\nExplain to the students how they learnpack exercises work:\n\nThere are 4 main exercises: Begin JS, Arrays, Functions, and Mastering Javascript, and they are supposed to be done in parallel because they share the same concepts E.g: You need to know about strings to know about functions because you probably will use a string within a function.\n\n1. They can start any series of exercises by clicking on the gitpod button in GitHub (using the gitpod extensions)\n2. Once the exercise engine is loaded and the exercises are running they can click \"next\" for each exercise.\n3. If the engine is down the can type `learnpack start` to restart the engine.\n\nThey have to complete all exercises by the end of the Bootcamp and repeat some of them if possible, particularly the \"arrays\" exercises.\n\n## Start Practicing\n\nOpen the begin js exercises and have the class take turns on the screen to complete each exercise during the class hours hours.\n\nNote: You can stop the class anytime and explain a javascript concept if you see they need to re-enforce the concept."

And you can get the length with `myArray.length`.\n- Concatenate stringgs using + and the new amazing type of quotes '`' that is easier for creating big dynamic strings.\n\n## `10 min` Talk about looping: with and without arrays (for vs foreach).\n\n- The main objective for a loop is to repeat a bunch of lines of code from the openin curly brace to the closing curly brace.\n- There are several ways of looping but we will focus mainly in the `for` loop for now.\n- Here is a 12min video explaining [all the different ways of looping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ZlQSOcOI0).\n- You can add elements to an array with `push`.\n\n## `10 min` Talk more in detail about functions\n\n- Functions are the last thing to learn about basic algorithms (encouragement).\n- You create a function when you find yourself doing the same thing all over.\n- Functions purpose is to receive an input and return an output.\n- The function stops executing after returning.\n- Functions SHOULD USE VARIABLES declared ourside of them (best practice).\n- Anonymus function vs normal function.\n- In javascript, we will only use arrow functions (no the original type of function) because they are more similar to other programming languages functions.\n\n## `2:20 min` hours Start coding with the students!\n\n- Ask students to use the boilerplate for vanila.js.\n- Read the instructions for the domain name generator and ask students to discuss and build the strategy on the whiteboard.\n\n## ⚠ ️IMPORTANT `before leaving` Invite them to the coding weekend\n\nThis is the most important coding weekend of the entire course because they have to understand JS well to be able to continue learning more stuff.\n"

In HTTP you can only print text, it can be an HTML Text, CSS Text, JSON Text, Javascript Test.\n3. Basically it means generating strings dynamically.\n4. Conditional rendering is what makes your website interactive.\n\n\n### There are 2 ways of writing conditions:  \n\nUsing the `if....else`  statement.  \n\n```js\nlet canDrive = false;\nif(age > 16){\n    // do something\n    canDrive = true;\n}\nelse{\n    canDrive = false;\n}\n```\nOr using a ternary (the most popular for conditional rendering):\n\n```js\nlet canDrive = (age > 16) ? true : false;\n```\nNote: as you can see the ternary is smaller, it's a great and agile resource.\n\n## What is conditional rendering?\n\nIt means using conditions to generate HTML dynamically. Basically, your HTML will be different depending on certain **conditions** that you determine.\n\nFor example, using the same condition before:\n```js\nlet canDrive = (age > 16) ? \"can\" : \"cannot\";\nlet myHTML = 'I ' + canDrive + \" drive\";\n\n// myHTML will be either \"I can drive\" or \"I cannot drive\"\n```\n\nWith the javascript template literrals is even easier to generate strings dynamically.\n\n```js\n\nlet person = {\n    name: \"Alejandro\",\n    age: 17\n}\nlet myHTML = `\n    <div>\n          <p>My name is ${person.name}</p>\n          <p>and I am ${person.age > 21 ? \"capable\" : \"not capable\"} to drink</p>\n    </div>\n`;\n```\nThis javascript code will output the following HTML:\n\n```html\n    <div>\n          <p>My name is Alejandro</p>\n          <p>and I am capable to drink</p>\n    </div>\n```\n\n"

Explan a simple function like the `sum` function that sums two numbers and how to test it:\n\n\n```js\n\nfunction sum(a,b){\n     // leave the function without implementation\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat should this function return? a+b\n\nIf I pass `5` and `7` to this function, what should the function return? `12`\n\nUnit tests are HARD CODED tests with very specific inputs to function and very specific expectations about the result of those functions.\n\n## How can you assert?\n\nThe word \"assert\" is used in many programming languages testing frameworks, asserting basically means comparing.\n\nWe are going to be learning in Javascript and Jest, instead of `assert` you have to say `expect`.\n\nDepending on the framework the syntax varies, but in javascript we assert with Jest like this:\n```js\nexpect(something).toBe(somehitngElse)\n```\n\nFor example: \n```js\ntest(\"If 5 and.7 are passed, then the function must return 12\", function(){\n    const sum  = require('./sum.js');\n    const total = sum(5,7);\n    expect(total).toBe(12);\n});\n```\n\nYou can find all the [jest expect functions here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect.html).\n\n## Testing for failure instead of success\n\n1. Try testing your functions for weird scenarios\n2. Try to break your functions with the wrong parameters.\n3. Think about all the possible scenarios.\n\n## `2hr` Start the interactive project\n\nThere is an interactive project available that will explain a lot to the students, start the project with them and let them finish it on their own."

React handles all of that. You will create your own components and tell react what component to render and when; react handles all interaction with DOM on the front end.\n- Now its all about component based, its a lot easier to re-use your code int he future.\n- It’s much faster than traditional javascript. Instead of re-rendering the whole page when a single change occurs, React renders individual items that change. \n\n#### You can create your own tags\n\n- Before, you learned that HTML Tags are set functions that the browser knows how to interpret.\n- Now in React, You can create your own tags by creating usable components.\n- Just create a function that returns HTML and that will become its own tag.\n- JSX its like HTML+JS you have to get use to it.\n- You have to use braces in the middle of your HTML to include dynamic JS.\n```jsx\nconst Alert = function(props){\n    return (<div className=\"any-class-name\">{props.children}</div>);\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(<div className=\"any-class-name\">{props.children}</div>)\n```\n- You have to use [proptypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (best practice).\n```js\nAlert.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node,\n  // any other property...\n};\n```\n\n## `1:25 min` Do the React Exercises with the students\n\nThe transition to react its hard for the students, that is why we will be doing the react exercises with them.\n\n## `60 min before class ends` Start the class project (Landing Page)\n\n- This project will be do in groups of two. \n- Every team must share the same git repository.\n- Take some time to read the instructions with the students and have them setup they boilerplate and repository.\n- Each group will strategize privatly how to approach the exercise."

State is declared inside the component.\n      2. Props are declared outside of the component and are read only within the inside of the component.\n\n- Show an example os using the useState.\n```js\n\n//            ⬇ value  ⬇ modifier                  ⬇ default\nconst [ value, setValue ] = useState(defaultValue);\n```\n- you can have as many states as you want\n\n### The state is inmutable:\n\nThis is wrong:\n```jsx\nconst [ todos, setTodos ] = useState([]);\n\n// ⬇  WRONG!!!!!  ⬇\nconst addTodo = (text) => {\n  todos.push(text)\n  setTodos(todos);\n}\n\n\n// ⬇  GOOD!!!!!  ⬇\nconst addTodo = (text) => {\n const newTodos =  todos.concat([text])\n  setTodos(newTodos);\n}\n```"

The probably feel overwhelmed.\n\nGood encouragment ideas:\n\n- Today is the last class we are introducing new concepts for front end.\n- This is everything your need to succeed as a developer for the next 5 years.\n- The next time you will have to study so much, you will do it with a great sallary!!\n\n## `5 min` Take any questions about fetch.js or any other theorical concept.\n\n## `10 min` Review React.js and Fetch\n\n- React is about components (component names MUST be written in caps)\n- You build components by creating functions or classes (both MUST start in capital letters)\n- Review how to create a class vs functional component\n- The component objective is to create HTML.\n- You can pass props to compoentns `<Tag property={value}>`\n- You can persist those variables to the DOM using `this.setState`\n- API Calls (fetch) should be done on `componentDidMount`\n- Review how to code a fetch\n\n```js\nfetch('url/to/fetch', additionalSettings)\n    .then(resp => {\n        console.log(resp.ok); // will be tru if the response is successfull\n        console.log(resp.status); // the status code = 200 or code = 400 etc.\n        console.log(resp.text()); // will try return the exact result as string\n        return resp.json(); // (returns promise) will try to parse the result as json as return a promise that you can .then for results\n    })\n    .then(data => {\n        //here is were your code should start after the fetch finishes\n        console.log(data); //this will print on the console the exact object received from the server\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n        //error handling\n        console.log(error);\n    })\n```\n\n# `20 min` Introduce FLUX\n\n- React created a way to share a store within the entire application.\n- Flux can be seen as an implementation of MVC on the front end side.\n- MVC = Model View Controller\n- Instead of Model View Controller here it is called: Model, View, Actions\n- The context-api will take care of propagating the store to all the views (re-render)\n\n![Context API](https://ucarecdn.com/051c4b0f-1c52-4cbe-a1b0-1d5fb074b8c4/)\n\n⚠️ Its a great idea to install the [react-hello-webapp boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp) and show/explain the demonstration that comes with it.\n\nInstall it with the class.\n\n### The Views\n\n- The views are your components that you don't re-use, like `<AboutUs />` or `<Home />`.\n- You other componets are not called views because they are meant to be reused in several projects like: `<Card />`, `<Carousel />` or `<Navbar />`\n\n```jsx\n    //example render method accessin the store and actions\n    render(){\n\t\treturn <Context.Consumer>\n            {({ actions, store }) => {\n\t\t\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t\t    <ul>\n\t\t\t\t    {\n\t\t\t\t        store.favorites.map(f => \n\t\t\t\t            <li onClick={() => actions.someAction(f)}>\n\t\t\t\t                {f.name}\n\t\t\t\t            </li>\n\t\t\t\t        )\n\t\t\t\t    }\n\t\t\t\t    </ul>\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t}}\n\t\t</Context.Consumer>\n\t}\n```\n\n### The Actions\n\n- Actions are triggered by the views onClick, onMouseOver or any other event.\n- Actions have only two purposes: \n    - Call API's to update the database.  \n    - Update the store for any particular purpose (add, update, delete).\n- Examples of actions can be: login, createStudent, removeStudent, etc. Actions names should be descriptive about the business.\n\n```js\n\tconst addToFavorites = elm => {\n\t\tconst store = getStore();\n\t\tsetStore({ favorites: store.favorites.concat([elm]) });\n\t};\n```\n\n### The Store\n\nIts a container of information shared on your entire application:\n\n- You have to initilize the store with `null` or `[]` or `''` depending on your the data-type your are storing.\n- The biggest challenge on the store is modeling your data: What structures should y use? What is better to store like an array than an object?\n- You can access your store from your views in a read-only mode.\n\n```js\n\tlet exampleStoreObject = {\n\t    favorites: [\n\t        { name: 'Luke Sky Walker', age: 32 },\n\t        { name: 'Chiwawa', age: 12 },\n\t        ...\n\t    ]\n\t};\n```\n\n\n## `2 hr` Project Time!\n\nReact the instructions for the starwars blog and strategize with the students:\n\n- How many views are needed?\n- What components you should create?\n- What are the actions that will be coded?\n- What data-struture do we need for the store?"

                        "extended_instructions": "# React Router \n\n## Time for some motivation!\n\nIt is probable that students don't understand things entirely. The probably feel overwhelmed. \nGood encouragement ideas:\n\n- Today is the last class we are introducing new concepts for the front end.\n- This is everything your need to succeed as a developer for the next 5 years.\n- The next time you will have to study so much, you will do it with a great sallary!!\n\n## `5 min` Take any questions about fetch.js or any other theorical concept.\n\n## `10 min` Review React.js and Fetch\n\n- React is about components (component names MUST be written in caps)\n- You build components by creating functions or classes (both MUST start in capital letters)\n- Review how to create a class vs functional component\n- The component objective is to create HTML.\n- You can pass props to compoentns `<Tag property={value}>`\n- You can persist those variables to the DOM using `this.setState`\n- API Calls (fetch) should be done on `componentDidMount`\n- Review how to code a fetch\n\n```js\nfetch('url/to/fetch', additionalSettings)\n    .then(resp => {\n        console.log(resp.ok); // will be tru if the response is successfull\n        console.log(resp.status); // the status code = 200 or code = 400 etc.\n        console.log(resp.text()); // will try return the exact result as string\n        return resp.json(); // (returns promise) will try to parse the result as json as return a promise that you can .then for results\n    })\n    .then(data => {\n        //here is were your code should start after the fetch finishes\n        console.log(data); //this will print on the console the exact object received from the server\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n        //error handling\n        console.log(error);\n    })\n```\n\n# `20 min` Introduce React Router\n\n- Most applications have multiple views, or urls.\n- You don't want the server to take care of \"routing\", all traffic must be redirected to index.html\n- The fronn't end will take care of routing the URL path with a particular View (a react component)\n- Views are react components that you don't typically re-use, like: contact-us, about-us, home, dashboard, etc.\n- React Router is the most popular library to \"route\" in React.\n\n## How to route\n\n- You need to create a parent component that will be instanciated first and take care of routing.\n- That component must use `<BrowserRouter>` and several `<Route>`'s inside like this:\n\n```jsx\n<BrowserRouter>\n     <Switch>\n          <Route path=\"/home\"><AnyView /></Route>\n          <Route path=\"/Dashboard\"><AnyOtherView /></Route>\n     </Switch>\n</BrowserRouter>\n```\n\nNote: We also need a `<Switch>` because we only one to display one route at time.\n\n### Passing arguments between views using the querystring\n\n- HTTP has something call a `queryString` \n- QueryStrings are a way to pass more information to a URL like this: [google.com/?q=what is react router](google.com/?q=what%20is%20react%20router)\n\nAs you can see there is a question mark `?` at the end of the URL and then there is a variable `q` equal to `what is react router`.\n\nBasically you can tell google.com that you want to query for \"what is react router\" thru the querystring.\n\nThe query string always starts with a question mark and then you add unlimited variables and values separated by amperson `&`, for example:\n\n`https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+react+router&start=20`\n\nIn this case we are passing two variables: `q` and `start`, we are telling google.com that we want to search for \"what is react router\" and we want to display from the result number 20 instead of 1, we are skipping the first 20 results.\n\n#### Retreiving the querystring\n\nYou can access the querystring from any react component like this:\n\n```jsx\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n    const q = urlParams.get('q');\n    const start = urlParams.get('start');\n\n    return <p>You want to query in google {q} starting from result {start}</p>\n}\n```\n\n### Passing arguments to views using params\n\nAside from the queryString there is another tool to pass information to views in react router, The Params.\n\n```jsx\n<BrowserRouter>\n     <Switch>\n          <Route path=\"/planets\"><AnyView /></Route>\n          <Route path=\"/single_planet/:planet_name\"><SinglePlanet /></Route>\n     </Switch>\n</BrowserRouter>\n```\n\nWe have two views in this example: `/planets` and `/single_planet/:planet_name`, the first one is going to render a list with all the planets in the solar system, the second one is going to display information about just ONE specific planet. At the end of the `/single_planet/:planet_name` URL you can see there is a color `:` like this: `:planet_name`, this means that `planet_name` will become a variable that will be replaced later with a value, for example:\n\n```txt\n/single_planet/earth\n/single_planet/mars\n/single_planet/neptune\n/single_planet/jupiter\n/single_planet/mercury\n```\n\nThe last part of that URL can vary with different planet_name's, and we can retrieve that information from the component view like this:\n\n```jsx\n\nimport { useParams } from \"react-router\";\n\nconst SinglePlanet = () => {\n    const { planet_name } = useParams();\n\n    return <p>You are displaying currently the planet {planetName}</p>\n}\n```\n\n## `2 hr` Project Time!\n\nReact the instructions for the starwars blog and strategize with the students:\n\n- How many views are needed?\n- What components you should create?\n- What are the actions that will be coded?\n- Today we don't care about the store or actions, lets focus on building the HTML views and the URL paths using react router."

A unique number that represents the \"session\".\n- How big is the token? Enough to be unique for everyone else.\n\n## Go over the lessons with the student\n\nTake some time to scroll through the lessons and review each of the concepts.\n\n## Use postman to demonstrate an authentication:\n\n  - Start with login (wrong and success credentials)\n  - Append the header token to the request.\n  - What is the response code we are getting?\n  - What happens if I add the wrong headers or token? What status code?\n\n## Documentation for JWT Extended\n\n- Show students the documentation for the [JWT Extended package](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic_usage/).\n- Help students understand how to read a documentation.\n  - What to look first? The quickstart?\n  - How many weekly downloads the package has?\n  - How actively maintained it is?\n  - Are there a lot of pending issues?\n  - Has anyone else tried the package?\n- Write on the board the 4 steps to implement it: \n\n## Allow students to implement the login and protected routs on the API\n\nAsk students to follow the documentation steps on their own and ask for questions.\n\n## Front-end:\n\n- Implementing the fetch function to post `/token` and get a new token.\n- Storing the token on the localStorage\n- Appending the token to the fetch headers on every private request \n\n## The Startwars API should have authentication for next class\n"

Are you stuck?\n    2. What do you need from me?\n\n## `10min` Using Github for Agile: Issues and Projects\n\n- There are plenty of agile methodologies but we decided to use Kanban as it is one of the most popular ones.\n- Explain github issues and how you can create one issue for eavery feature/bug/problem/etc.\n- Github issues can connect to github projects automatically.\n- Create a github project with the students: What is a Kanban board and how does it work: 4 Columns (Backlog, Selected for Development, In Progress, Done).\n- How to use Github's kanban automated board: Issues will automatically opened and closed.\n\n## `20min` Students must pick their final project\n\n- Have a brainstorming on the project, here are some examples:\n    1. Doing an SMS based todo list application.\n    2. Doing a real-time polling platform like pollanywhere: https://www.polleverywhere.com/\n    3. Doing a Markdown editor to take notes and save them in the cloud.\n    4. Doing a detting platform where games can bet on anyone playing a video game.\n    5. Online store.\n- Once you ahve teams and ideas ready the teams must gather up and one of each team must create their repository.\n- Each team must start adding github issues with their user stories.\n\n## `2:20min` Build project stories\n\nStudents must work in group with their teams to finish the first batch of user stories and wireframes and publish them into github.\n\n"

E.g: \"I like dogs\" or \"I work on sales\", etc.\n- Put all papers inside a cup and start the game.\n- Choose one student to start introducing himself:\n    - First name and last.\n    - What would you like to be called?\n    - What do you do now? (for work)\n    - What do you plan on doing when you become a developer?\n- Then, that student must pick one random paper from the cup and guess how is the person that wrote it.\n- After guessing, the person who wrote it must come next and introduce himself and pick another paper... etc.\n\n## `5 min` Present the team\n\nEveryone introduces himself: Chief of Admissions, Chief of Career Support, Chief of Education, Main instructor, and teacher assistant.\n\n## `15 min` Install the tools\n\nStart with Gitpod, invite all students, and make sure they are able to create workspaces and what the academy boilerplates are. \n\n## `10 min` Go over prework concepts really fast\n\nCheck if the students completed the prework, if ~70% of the students finished the prework you can continue with the rest of the class, otherwise you will have to postpone today's topics and today's focus only con starting/completing the prework projects and concepts with the students.\n\n\n## If 70% of the students completed the prework you can continue with the rest of the day:\n\n### How does the internet works?\n\n1. The world is divided between servers and clients.\n2. We call \"clients\" the computers with browsers or mobile apps.\n3. We call servers where the centralized database is.\n\n### HTTP Request vs Response**\n\n- The rules used for this client-sever communication is called HTTP, which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.\n- The way that you get the website is by sending a \"Request\" to the server. This tells the server what website or resource you are looking to view/use. The server then responds with the information.\n- The server then sends a response, which tells will confirm the receipt of the request and let your computer know that it will begin sending data.\n- This back and forth process will continue with more Request=>Response pairs until you have finished loading your remote resource.\n\n### Everything is text!\n\n- With HTTP, it’s important to focus on the first T in the acronym, which stands for `Text`. In this protocol, everything is sent back and forth as TEXT.\n- While there are other protocols out there, for now, we want to remember that with HTTP – Everything is TEXT.\n- Make students open a picture with Notepad/TextEdit they will see the text that represents the image.\n\n### Browser Interpretation\n\n- After your browser uses the HTTP protocol and receives the data as text, it then has the job of interpreting that text and converting it to the correct visual format.\n\n#### HTML\n\n- The first TEXT-based format we will see is HTML.\n- HTML its all about `<tags>` you open and close tags to give them basic format.\n- There are a lot of HTML tags but you only have to know a few and you can always google them.\n    - Explain the basic tags like `<p>`,`<div>`,`<a>`,`<span>`, headings (`<h1>`,`<h2>`,etc).\n\n[[demo]]\n| :point_up: The most important thing to remember in HTML is to ALWAYS BE CLOSING!\n\n#### Always Be Closing and Indentation Matters**\n\n- Everything is going to be done in blocks of code.\n- First you open the block, then you close the block.\n\n### CSS vs HTML\n```css\n#id_selector { property: value; }\n.class_selector { property: value; }\ntag_selector { property: value; }\n```\n\n## `20 min` Start the new content: Advanced CSS\n\n### Specificity\n\n- Do not use ID as CSS selectors (use specificity).\n- The class selector is the most used because it can be reused all over your website.\n- Show this [video that explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In78mSOHmls) specificity to the class.\n- Combine selectors to get more specific about which element you are styling\n- Ask if anyone remembers what we said DRY Programming means? Don’t repeat yourself.\nYou may think it’s funny that they call the opposite of DRY -  WET programming, which they have given the following titles to:  \"write everything twice\", \"we enjoy typing\" or \"waste everyone's time\"**\n\n\n### Box Model\n\n- Box layout means that most elements can be thought of as boxes: with margin, padding, with and height.\n- There are 4 main parts to the typical box model: (draw the following on the board or show picture from breathcode)\n    - Content: this is what is inside the box\n    - Padding: this is spacing between the border and content (inside box also)\n    - Border: this is the edge of the box\n    - Margin: this is spacing between the outside of the box and the next element over in any direction. (which could be the edge of the page, another div, a paragraph, or even an image)\n- You can also have a background color or image, this will show in the content area of your box.\n\n#### The Display Property:\n\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline`: Display block its what makes an element behave like a box, inline elements have no margins.\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\n- Display: flex; its the main tool for building complex layouts because it easily allows having several divs on the same line (columns).\n- I recommend going over the CSS and HTML [cheat sheets that we have available on the breathco.de platform under Assets](https://breatheco.de/assets/).\n \n## Display Flex and how important it is.\n\nTake some time to explain display:flex and how it is used on today's project.\n\n#### The Position Property:\n\n- Position:fixed follows the user, it is mainly used for anoying modals or popups.\n- If one element has position:relative must always be companioned by one or more childs with position:absolute. Its broadly used for relating two elements to each other (one follows the other)\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\n\n## `2:30 hr` Start the project!\n\nRead the instructions out loud with the class, make sure they understand.\n\nStudents must start discussing on the whiteboard a strategy about the project.\n- From top to bottom identify the tags you will be using.\n- When to use `display:inline-block` and/or `position:absolute` or `position:relative`.\n- Setup the project with one `index.html` and one `styles.css`\n\n\n\nAnswer questions individually with your teacher assistants.\n"

Navbar\n2. Card\n3. Modal: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#live-demo\n\n### The Basic Workflow (asuming you have a wireframe or design)\n\n1. Build your basic layout with the Grid (container, row and collumns)\n1. Identify the components you will need (use piece of paper)\n2. Copy & Paste the component code into your website.\n3. Customize the component for your specific design.\n4. Adjust anything else overriding with css styles on your own sylesheet.\n5. Remember the utility classes to avoid doing to much custom CSS.\n\n### Helper/Utility Classes that come with bootstrap*\n\nThese are classes you can attach that do things such as control margin or padding, control borders, or even float elements.\nFor example, if you wanted no margin on the left of the element, you can add the class ml-0 to the element and it will set the left margin to zero.\n\n### Layout using Grid system\n\n- Explain 12 column layout and how it works\n- every line is a Row\n- this row holds columns as immediate childs\n- every Row on a page has 12 columns\n- columns are equally measured in percentages so they are responsive.\n- the basic sizes are: col, col-xs, col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl\n\n### Bootstrap does not have fonts or icons\n\nWe use google fonts and font awesome for that.\n\n## `2:30min` Have class work on bootstrap instagram.\n\n- Students gather in pairs tos strategize first (best practice)\n- Read instructions out loud and have them build a strategy\n- Have them identify the components.\n\nDo not talk more, they will not be able to process it because they are overwhelmed, just help them code."

Draw on the board a file hierarchy and show if at the same time how the command line shows it (compare both).\n- Explain the use of the autocomplete command: [using tab one time for autocomplete or two times to show options](https://www.howtogeek.com/195207/use-tab-completion-to-type-commands-faster-on-any-operating-system/).\n- This is a [very good series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO0jzD1hpXc&t=267s&index=8&list=PL8A83A276F0D85E70) explaining the command line that students can **watch later.**\n- Share this [cheat sheet with the most used commands.](https://ucarecdn.com/61c6474b-5760-43db-9a2c-dfbea2ccdd76/Comandlinecheatsheet.pdf)\n\n## `1:20 hr` Start The CMD Challenge\n\n- Have students create a project in Gitpod\n- Help them to clone the repo for the project (paste it in the slack channel so they can use the link)**\n    1. git init\n    2. git clone\n- Run the react presentation\n\n```md\n📝 The command line will make students practice the most important commands, explain each command after the each challenge is completed, the student that successfully completed it can explain to other students.\n```\n\n## `1:30min` Take some time the class explaining git in a general way\n\nGit will be the first applicacion we will be using inside the command line, students must read about it and wat videos about it.\n\n### What is git?\n\nGit is an online, central code storage that allows developers to manage a code base in teams.\n\nSome of the things you can do with git include:\n\n1. You can collaborate on projects easily\n2. see a history of revisions\n3. Roll back to previous versions if a revision fails (version control)\n4. Resolve code conflicts so that 2 developers don’t overwrite each other’s code.\n\nGit is a necessity to any developer working today as it’s resolved many of the issues of working on a team or keeping version history on a project.\n\n## For Next Class\n\nNext class we will review GIT in more detail. If you haven’t already, please read the lesson on GIT in the breatheco.de platform.**Hello *World*!"

                        "extended_instructions": "# First time using Git\n\nLast class you have introduced GitHub, students must have finish reading and watching videos and building their public profile with YML.\n\n### About the GIT authentication:\n\nThe academy does not want to explain much about GIT SSH Authentication because it can be a cumbersome concept for now, we strongly recomend always using HTTP during the course and let students learn about SSH later.\n\n### The Commit Object\n\nHere is the lesson that talks about that: [https://content.breatheco.de/lesson/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#commit-objects](https://content.breatheco.de/lesson/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#commit-objects) \n\nBasically, a commit is a snapshot (picture) of what your project looked at during the moment of your commit. \n\nCommits represent a change in the current code, so if you don’t have any changes, you will receive a message saying there is nothing to commit.\n\nThere are four main parts in a commit:\n\n1. Set of files which make up your snapshot at that time\n2. Instructions pointing to the Parent commit objects\n3. An SH1 (hash) name that serves as a unique identifier for that specific commit.\n4. Commits also typically have comments, which should explain what was changed or addressed in the current commit\n\n### The HEAD\n\nThe heads of the repository are like the \"revision history of the project.\"  \n\nA revision history is a list of commit objects that altogether contain all the changes that you and your other team members have made to the project files.\n\nEvery time you make a new commit, the head will move to that new commit.  (This way you are able to have access to the entire project history of commits.)\n\nIt is possible to move the head to a different commit, however, you must remember that commits made after the commit to which the head is pointing at are not possible to be reviewed.\n\n### The Stage\n\nWhen creating a commit, you select which files you wish to add to the commit. This is called \"staging\" your commit. (basically, preparing your formal commit object)\n\nTypically, you will use \"git add .\" which adds all files to your stage for the current commit, then follow it with your commit.\n\n### Branch\n\nA branch allows you to work on a specific feature of code without compromising the main code in a repository.  [http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits](http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits) \n\nThat means that each branch is a separate revision history.\n\nThe main branch of code in the repository is called \"Master\" typically\n\nYou can have as many different branches as you want in a repository/project.\n\nEach branch has it’s own head which resides on the last commit of that branch. So if you have two branches, \"Master\" and “login”, each will have their own head on the last commit.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the feature you developed, you can merge it back in to master and it will bring all code changes, along with replace the head on master with the new head.\n\n### Typical Flow\n\n1. All new projects have to be initialized with git.  (git init)\n    - This creates a git folder with all elements that define the git project.\n    - At this point, it’s also good to set the remote for your project. This will tell the project what the address is for your repository so that you can push changes later.\n\n 2. the command for this is:  git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git \n\n 3. where the address at the end is your repository address or SSH address.\n\n26. Whenever you have to stage your changes, you use \"git add\". As mentioned before, to add all file changes, “git add .” \n\n > Note: conversely, you can condense this into the git commit by adding a flag \"-a\" which means add all files to the commit stage\n\n4. Once you made changes to your code and you are ready to commit: You create a commit object by using \"git commit -m ‘commit message’\" or if you have not used git add, you can use the -a flag as mentioned before.\n\n5. At this point, you want to use ‘git push’ to upload your changes\n\n6. If you need to create a new branch:\n\n    - git checkout -b [branch name]\n\n    - next you need to switch to that branch to work on it\n\n        3. git checkout [branch name]\n\n    - when you complete your changes on a new branch, you merge the changes back in using the following:\n\n        4. git merge [other branch name]\n\n\n## Commit vs PUSH\n\nWe already discussed that a commit will allow you to create a new commit object. This is a local bundle you are preparing to upload.\n\nWhen you finish your commit, you have to attempt to upload that code to the repository.\n\nThis is where git push comes in. It allows you to attempt to upload your changes to the repository.\n\nIf there are any issues where a conflict has arisen, you will have to resolve the conflicts before pushing your changes.\n\n## Resolving Conflicts\n\nFor conflicts, git will notify you that there are issues.\n\n- this typically occurs when two people are trying to modify the same file(s).\n\nTo proceed you need to:\n\n- Get the new changes downloaded to your computer with ‘git pull’ or if you are on a branch, ‘git pull origin branch-name’\n\n- Then you will be asked to merge the changes \n\n- Here you will have to edit the files with conflicts and resolve any changes. \n\n- Once you have resolved the conflicts, you can attempt to push changes again.\n\n## Start Coding With The Students!\n\n** At this point we will start the assignment for the git collaborative portfolio project.**\n\n** Break the class into groups and assign a section of the portfolio project**\n\n** [https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-collaborative-html-website/blob/master/website1/designs/guide.jpg]**(https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-collaborative-html-website/blob/master/website1/designs/guide.jpg)\n\n* Use peer programming to complete the section quickly, then upload the changes to the repository your professor has provided.\n\nTeacher will clone the repo in a new class repository and will handle updating the name of the template parts so that the site functions properly.\n\n### Students Homework: \n\nFinish all pending projects including todays."

Students will be overwhelmed.\n\n### Why Javascript?\n\nStatic websites are just blog posts, but was about interactive applications like Instagram, Facebook, etc.?\n\nJavascript lets us create dynamic HTML and CSS based on user or system interactions, for example:\n- Adding an `li` to a `ul` when the user clicks on a button.\n- Showing a banner or ad (publicity) based on the user IP address.\n- Ask for information to a database.\n- Write on a database using AJAX.\n- etc.\n\nBasically: Javascript its a programming language to generate HTML and CSS (text) based on events.\n\n## The`<script>` tag:\n\nAll javascript must be done on a separate sheet (best practice).\nYou have to import to put that tag **right before the body closing tag**.\nThe code execution starts on the `window.onload = function(){}` like this:\n```\n//index.js\n\nwindow.onload = function(){\n    //your code here\n}\n\n//you can declar other functions here, but please don't write code outside functions\n```\n\n**Warning**: Carefull explaining the windown.onload, because today we are not suppose to overwhelme them with events and functions.\n\n### Explain Variables:\n\nVariables are javascript’s version of containers that hold some information.\n\nAn example of this is:\n\n1. Let’s say we needed to store someone’s birthday for an age verification script\n2. One of our variables might be: `var day = 29;`\n3. There are three things going on here:\n    - First, the computer interprets the letters VAR as the beginnig of a variable declaration.\n    - After `VAR` it must always come the variable name: in our case is called `day`.\n    - Secondly, we are storing a value of 29 in that variable.\n    - Finally, notice the syntax. All javascript lines typically end with semicolon. There will be some cases where you don’t use semicolon and we will learn those later but for now, all lines are with semicolon.\n\n3. Given that we defined the var above, `var day = 29;` if we want to display it for testing, we can show use the javascript console:\n    - Explain how to open the google inspector console\n    - So to display the variable, you would use: `console.log(day);`\n    - will print on the console `29`\n\n### Data Types\n\nYou can store 6 differnt types of values: Strings, Integers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects, Functions, Null and Undefined.\n\n- Boolean - true/false\n- String - always in quotes\n- Number - any type of number -  integer numbers, negative numbers, decimal numbers, floats, etc.\n- Undefined - nothing was set or specified for the variable. so the variable has no value\n- Null - When a database or function returns nothing, it returns null\n- Array - data sets [2,3,4,\"cat\",242,\"d\"]\n- Object - You can explain objects like real life objects that are comprised by other datatypes, you can use the analogy with HTML Tags because the tags have properties taht describe them further. Objects behave the same way.\n\nNote: Data Types on Breatheco.de: [http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types](http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types)\n\n### String Contatenation\n\nSuming two integers its not the same as suming two strings, as web developers we are going to be creating HTML using Javascript, we will contatenate like crazy!\n\n### Arrays\n\nSince we just learned what an array is, let’s look at some basic properties of an array:\n\n1. value or item: The value stored on each position.\n2. index or position: the position of the given value in the array `note: the first position starts at 0`\n3. length - the total length of the array\n\nDeclaring an array [http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-an-array-define-array](http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-an-array-define-array#how-to-declare-an-array)\n\nTo initialize an array , you can use the following:\n```js\nlet myArray = [];\n```\nThis defines the array as an empty set so that you can add values later.\n\nNote: Don’t use, use let or const.\n\nYou can also initialize an array with a value in it**\n```js\nlet myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];\n```\nDisplaying the value of an array using console, we can show it as `console.log(myArray[0]);`\n\nUpdating a specific position: `myArray[4]=3;`\n\nGenerating a random number using `Math.rand()`\n\n## Javascript Exercises and Learnpack\n\nExplain to the students how they learnpack exercises work:\n\nThere are 4 main exercises: Begin JS, Arrays, Functions, and Mastering Javascript, and they are supposed to be done in parallel because they share the same concepts E.g: You need to know about strings to know about functions because you probably will use a string within a function.\n\n1. They can start any series of exercises by clicking on the gitpod button in GitHub (using the gitpod extensions)\n2. Once the exercise engine is loaded and the exercises are running they can click \"next\" for each exercise.\n3. If the engine is down the can type `learnpack start` to restart the engine.\n\nThey have to complete all exercises by the end of the Bootcamp and repeat some of them if possible, particularly the \"arrays\" exercises.\n\n## Start Practicing\n\nOpen the begin js exercises and have the class take turns on the screen to complete each exercise during the class hours hours.\n\nNote: You can stop the class anytime and explain a javascript concept if you see they need to re-enforce the concept."

Once the exercise engine is loaded and the exercises are running they can click \"next\" for each exercise.\n3. If the engine is down the can type `learnpack start` to restart the engine.\n\nThey have to complete all exercises by the end of the Bootcamp and repeat some of them if possible, particularly the \"arrays\" exercises.\n\n## `30min` Continue Practicing and give homework\n\nOpen the function js exercises and have the class take turns on the screen to complete each exercise during the 3 hours.\n\nNote: You can stop the class anytime and explain a javascript concept if you see they need to re-enforce the concept."

And you can get the length with `myArray.length`.\n- Concatenate stringgs using + and the new amazing type of quotes '`' that is easier for creating big dynamic strings.\n\n## `10 min` Talk about looping: with and without arrays (for vs foreach).\n\n- The main objective for a loop is to repeat a bunch of lines of code from the openin curly brace to the closing curly brace.\n- There are several ways of looping but we will focus mainly in the `for` loop for now.\n- Here is a 12min video explaining [all the different ways of looping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ZlQSOcOI0).\n- You can add elements to an array with `push`.\n\n## `10 min` Talk more in detail about functions\n\n- Functions are the last thing to learn about basic algorithms (encouragement).\n- You create a function when you find yourself doing the same thing all over.\n- Functions purpose is to receive an input and return an output.\n- The function stops executing after returning.\n- Functions SHOULD USE VARIABLES declared ourside of them (best practice).\n- Anonymus function vs normal function.\n- In javascript, we will only use arrow functions (no the original type of function) because they are more similar to other programming languages functions.\n\n## `2:20 min` hours Start coding with the students!\n\n- Ask students to use the boilerplate for vanila.js.\n- Read the instructions for the domain name generator and ask students to discuss and build the strategy on the whiteboard.\n\n## ⚠ ️IMPORTANT `before leaving` Invite them to the coding weekend\n\nThis is the most important coding weekend of the entire course because they have to understand JS well to be able to continue learning more stuff.\n"

In HTTP you can only print text, it can be an HTML Text, CSS Text, JSON Text, Javascript Test.\n3. Basically it means generating strings dynamically.\n4. Conditional rendering is what makes your website interactive.\n\n\n### There are 2 ways of writing conditions:  \n\nUsing the `if....else`  statement.  \n\n```js\nlet canDrive = false;\nif(age > 16){\n    // do something\n    canDrive = true;\n}\nelse{\n    canDrive = false;\n}\n```\nOr using a ternary (the most popular for conditional rendering):\n\n```js\nlet canDrive = (age > 16) ? true : false;\n```\nNote: as you can see the ternary is smaller, it's a great and agile resource.\n\n## What is conditional rendering?\n\nIt means using conditions to generate HTML dynamically. Basically, your HTML will be different depending on certain **conditions** that you determine.\n\nFor example, using the same condition before:\n```js\nlet canDrive = (age > 16) ? \"can\" : \"cannot\";\nlet myHTML = 'I ' + canDrive + \" drive\";\n\n// myHTML will be either \"I can drive\" or \"I cannot drive\"\n```\n\nWith the javascript template literrals is even easier to generate strings dynamically.\n\n```js\n\nlet person = {\n    name: \"Alejandro\",\n    age: 17\n}\nlet myHTML = `\n    <div>\n          <p>My name is ${person.name}</p>\n          <p>and I am ${person.age > 21 ? \"capable\" : \"not capable\"} to drink</p>\n    </div>\n`;\n```\nThis javascript code will output the following HTML:\n\n```html\n    <div>\n          <p>My name is Alejandro</p>\n          <p>and I am capable to drink</p>\n    </div>\n```\n\n"

Try testing your functions for weird scenarios\n2. Try to break your functions with the wrong parameters.\n3. Think about all the possible scenarios.\n\n## `2hr` Start the interactive project\n\nThere is an interactive project available that will explain a lot to the students, start the project with them and let them finish it on their own."

React handles all of that. You will create your own components and tell react what component to render and when; react handles all interaction with DOM on the front end.\n- Now its all about component based, its a lot easier to re-use your code int he future.\n- It’s much faster than traditional javascript. Instead of re-rendering the whole page when a single change occurs, React renders individual items that change. \n\n#### You can create your own tags\n\n- Before, you learned that HTML Tags are set functions that the browser knows how to interpret.\n- Now in React, You can create your own tags by creating usable components.\n- Just create a function that returns HTML and that will become its own tag.\n- JSX its like HTML+JS you have to get use to it.\n- You have to use braces in the middle of your HTML to include dynamic JS.\n```jsx\nconst Alert = function(props){\n    return (<div className=\"any-class-name\">{props.children}</div>);\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(<div className=\"any-class-name\">{props.children}</div>)\n```\n- You have to use [proptypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (best practice).\n```js\nAlert.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node,\n  // any other property...\n};\n```\n\n## `1:25 min` Do the React Exercises with the students\n\nThe transition to react its hard for the students, that is why we will be doing the react exercises with them.\n\n## `60 min before class ends` Start the class project (Landing Page)\n\n- This project will be do in groups of two. \n- Every team must share the same git repository.\n- Take some time to read the instructions with the students and have them setup they boilerplate and repository.\n- Each group will strategize privatly how to approach the exercise."

State is declared inside the component.\n      2. Props are declared outside of the component and are read only within the inside of the component.\n\n- Show an example os using the useState.\n```js\n\n//            ⬇ value  ⬇ modifier                  ⬇ default\nconst [ value, setValue ] = useState(defaultValue);\n```\n- you can have as many states as you want\n\n### The state is inmutable:\n\nThis is wrong:\n```jsx\nconst [ todos, setTodos ] = useState([]);\n\n// ⬇  WRONG!!!!!  ⬇\nconst addTodo = (text) => {\n  todos.push(text)\n  setTodos(todos);\n}\n\n\n// ⬇  GOOD!!!!!  ⬇\nconst addTodo = (text) => {\n const newTodos =  todos.concat([text])\n  setTodos(newTodos);\n}\n```"

What is better to store like an array than an object?\n- You can access your store from your views in a read-only mode.\n\n```js\n\tlet exampleStoreObject = {\n\t    favorites: [\n\t        { name: 'Luke Sky Walker', age: 32 },\n\t        { name: 'Chiwawa', age: 12 },\n\t        ...\n\t    ]\n\t};\n```\n\n\n## `2 hr` Project Time!\n\nReact the instructions for the starwars blog and strategize with the students:\n\n- How many views are needed?\n- What components you should create?\n- What are the actions that will be coded?\n- What data-struture do we need for the store?"

At the end of the `/single_planet/:planet_name` URL you can see there is a color `:` like this: `:planet_name`, this means that `planet_name` will become a variable that will be replaced later with a value, for example:\n\n```txt\n/single_planet/earth\n/single_planet/mars\n/single_planet/neptune\n/single_planet/jupiter\n/single_planet/mercury\n```\n\nThe last part of that URL can vary with different planet_name's, and we can retrieve that information from the component view like this:\n\n```jsx\n\nimport { useParams } from \"react-router\";\n\nconst SinglePlanet = () => {\n    const { planet_name } = useParams();\n\n    return <p>You are displaying currently the planet {planetName}</p>\n}\n```\n\n## `2 hr` Project Time!\n\nReact the instructions for the starwars blog and strategize with the students:\n\n- How many views are needed?\n- What components you should create?\n- What are the actions that will be coded?\n- Today we don't care about the store or actions, lets focus on building the HTML views and the URL paths using react router."

(Data-structures)\n\nThe front end is all about rendering and requesting for data.\nThe backend is all about databases/structures and responding the data.\n\nToday we are starting backend by going over all the previous exercises we have done and thinking about how the data was structured on those exercises.\n\n## Data structures\n\nDifferent Types of Data Structures (with examples):\n\n### Structuring with Primitive values\n\nThese are the most basic structures of data: Amost no structure, you cannot even have list of things.\n\n### Structuring with Arrays\n\nIs the first read structure we saw, its ideal to store lists of `anything`:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [];\n//add a task\ntodos.push(value);\n//remove a task\ntodos = task.filter(t => t != value);\n```\n\n### Object Literals\n\nThanks to object literals our tasks can now have status instead of just the task name.\n```js\nlet todos = [];\n//add a task\ntodos.push({\n    status: 'pending',\n    name: value\n});\n//remove a task\ntodos = task.filter(t => t.value != value);\n```\n\n### Classes (Object Orienetd)\n\nIts very formal, but thanks to classes now we can validate our task creation:\n\n```js\nclass TodoList{\n    constructor(){\n        this.tasks = [];\n    }\n    add(task){\n        if(valtaskue.status != 'pending' || task.status != 'done') throw new Error('The task status must be pending or done');\n        if(typeof task.name != 'string' || task.name == '') throw new Error('The task name must be a not empty string');\n        this.tasks.push(value);\n    }\n    remove(name){\n        this.tasks = this.tasks.filter(t => t.name != name);\n    }\n}\n\nlet todos = new TodoList();\n//now if you try adding a task with the wrong status if will give you an error\ntodos.add({\n    status: 'pending',\n    name: 'Make the bed'\n});\ntodos.remove('Make the bed');\n```\n\n## `5 min` Take 5 minutes to explain the difference beween data-structures and data-models\n\nYou can think about data-structures like he RAM Memory repersentation of data-models, for example:\n\n- Data structures are stuff like: Arrays, Queues (FIFO, FILO), Classes, etc.\n- Data models are ways of structuring the database.\n\nThe data-structure of your Reac.tjs projects will: The Store (RAM Memory).\nBut the data-model is only represented on the backend database.\n\n## `60min` Data Structuring Previous Projects\n\nStudents must discuss and finish recognizing the data structures use don previous projects.\n\n## `Rest of the class` Work on the SQL Exercises (the link is at the end of the lesson)."

One endpoint ==> One function\n\n```py\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    return 'Hello, World!'\n```\n\nExplain the rest of the process on building an API:  \nhttps://content.breatheco.de/en/lesson/building-apis-with-python-flask\n\n## `1hr` Follow the Interactive Flask API Tutorial\n\nHave the class work on following the API tutorial with Flask (todo list).\n\n## `1:30min` Start the StarWars with the class\n\n- The academy is providing documentation for the Flask Boilerplate here: [start.4geeksacademy.com](https://start.4geeksacademy.com)\n- Explain the backend boilerplate before starting the project\n- The models.py (based on the database diagram)\n- Where to add your endpoints\n- How to communicate between Python and your database using SQLAlchemy:\n   - How to query information.\n   - How to add, delete and update new records.\n- Build the first endpoint with the class\n- How to test your endpoints with postman\n\nThe class must continue working on the API until next day (homework)\n\n\n\n\n"

A unique number that represents the \"session\".\n- How big is the token? Enough to be unique for everyone else.\n\n## Go over the lessons with the student\n\nTake some time to scroll through the lessons and review each of the concepts.\n\n## Use postman to demonstrate an authentication:\n\n  - Start with login (wrong and success credentials)\n  - Append the header token to the request.\n  - What is the response code we are getting?\n  - What happens if I add the wrong headers or token? What status code?\n\n## Documentation for JWT Extended\n\n- Show students the documentation for the [JWT Extended package](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic_usage/).\n- Help students understand how to read a documentation.\n  - What to look first? The quickstart?\n  - How many weekly downloads the package has?\n  - How actively maintained it is?\n  - Are there a lot of pending issues?\n  - Has anyone else tried the package?\n- Write on the board the 4 steps to implement it: \n\n## Allow students to implement the login and protected routs on the API\n\nAsk students to follow the documentation steps on their own and ask for questions.\n\n## Front-end:\n\n- Implementing the fetch function to post `/token` and get a new token.\n- Storing the token on the localStorage\n- Appending the token to the fetch headers on every private request \n\n## The Startwars API should have authentication for next class\n"

Are you stuck?\n    2. What do you need from me?\n\n## `10min` Using Github for Agile: Issues and Projects\n\n- There are plenty of agile methodologies but we decided to use Kanban as it is one of the most popular ones.\n- Explain github issues and how you can create one issue for eavery feature/bug/problem/etc.\n- Github issues can connect to github projects automatically.\n- Create a github project with the students: What is a Kanban board and how does it work: 4 Columns (Backlog, Selected for Development, In Progress, Done).\n- How to use Github's kanban automated board: Issues will automatically opened and closed.\n\n## `20min` Students must pick their final project\n\n- Have a brainstorming on the project, here are some examples:\n    1. Doing an SMS based todo list application.\n    2. Doing a real-time polling platform like pollanywhere: https://www.polleverywhere.com/\n    3. Doing a Markdown editor to take notes and save them in the cloud.\n    4. Doing a detting platform where games can bet on anyone playing a video game.\n    5. Online store.\n- Once you ahve teams and ideas ready the teams must gather up and one of each team must create their repository.\n- Each team must start adding github issues with their user stories.\n\n## `2:20min` Build project stories\n\nStudents must work in group with their teams to finish the first batch of user stories and wireframes and publish them into github.\n\n"
